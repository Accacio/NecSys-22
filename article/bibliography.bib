  abstract = {In this paper, we present an analysis of the vulnerability
                  of a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) scheme in the
                  context of cyber-security. We consider different types of the
                  so-called insider attacks. In particular, we consider the
                  situation where one of the local controllers sends false
                  information to others to manipulate costs for its own
                  advantage. Then, we propose a popular scenario-based mechanism
                  to protect or, at least, relieve the consequences of the
                  attack in a typical DMPC negotiation process. The theoretical
                  and algorithmic properties of this defense mechanism are also
                  analyzed. A real case study based on a four tank plant is
                  provided to illustrate both the consequences of the attacks
                  and the defense mechanisms.},

                  agents that interact to solve problems that may be beyond the
                  capabilities of a single agent or system. For many years,
                  conceptual MAS designs and architectures have been proposed
                  for applications in power systems and power engineering. With
                  the increasing use and modeling of distributed energy
                  resources for microgrid applications, MAS are well suited to
                  manage the size and complexity of these energy systems. The
                  purpose of this paper is to survey applications of MAS in the
                  control and operation of microgrids. The paper will review MAS
                  concepts, architectures, develop platforms and processes,
                  provide example applications, and discuss limitations.},
