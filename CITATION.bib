  abstract        = {Controlling large-scale systems sometimes requires
                  decentralized computation. Communication among agents is
                  crucial to achieving consensus and optimal global behavior.
                  These negotiation mechanisms are sensitive to attacks on those
                  exchanges. This paper proposes an algorithm based on
                  Expectation Maximization to mitigate the effects of attacks in
                  a resource allocation based distributed model predictive
                  control. The performance is assessed through an academic
                  example of the temperature control of multiple rooms under
                  input power constraints.},
